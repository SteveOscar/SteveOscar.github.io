    <p id="content">The idea that space and time themselves are not immutable,
    but are dynamical quantities that can evolve through the history of the
    universe, is one of Einstein’s most dramatic legacies. It was so profound
    that Einstein himself had trouble accepting all the implications of the idea.
    When he investigated the universe as a whole in general relativity, he found
    that it should be expanding or contracting, not staying at a fixed size. That
    went contrary to his intuition, as well as to what astronomers of the time
    actually thought the universe was doing. When Edwin Hubble discovered the
    expansion of the universe in the 1920’s, Einstein realized that he had missed
    the opportunity to make one of the great predictions in the history of science.
