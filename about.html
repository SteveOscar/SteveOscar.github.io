    I worked for 10 years as a commercial fisherman in Alaska before enrolling
      at the <a href="http://turing.io/">Turing School of Software and Design</a>, where I'm currently
      studying full stack web development. I have a BA in English from Colorado Mesa University, and a
      passion for travel and photography.
