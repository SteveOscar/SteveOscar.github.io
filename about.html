      As a current student of the <a href="http://turing.io/">Turing School of Software and Design</a>, I'm studying full stack web development and love being immersed in a culture of intense learning. I have a BA in English (creative writing) from Colorado Mesa University, and a passion for technology travel and photography. Before begging my tech journey in earnest, I worked for nearly a decade as a commercial fisherman in Alaska and traveled to ~25 countries in the off seasons.
