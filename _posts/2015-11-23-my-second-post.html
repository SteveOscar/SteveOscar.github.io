  <p id="content">Magic Leap, which has raised half a billion dollars from
    investors including Google, has been building its technology in secret for
    years. But it's getting closer to show us its version of mixed-reality
    computing. "We're actually gearing up to build millions of things," said
    Rony Abovitz, the company's president and CEO, speaking at the WSJD conference
    in Laguna Beach, CA. The company is using part of an abandoned Motorola
    factory in south Florida and is now developing its manufacturing processes,
    he said. "We're not ready to announce when we're shipping, but it gives you
    a signal that we're not far," Abovitz said.<br>
