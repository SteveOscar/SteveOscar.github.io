<p id="content">The Raspberry Pi Foundation has upped the ante when it comes to low cost single board computers, announcing a new additional to its family of microprocessors today, called Pi Zero. And it costs…  just $5. (Or £4 in the U.K.)

Or it should cost $5, albeit you may have to shop aroundthe various Pi resellers to get it for that baseline price. And international buyers in certain regions may find they’re still paying a premium. But the Foundation’s intention is the Pi Zero retails for just five bucks.

“We really hope this is going to get those last few people in the door and involved in computer programming,” says Pi co-founder Eben Upton in a video (embedded below) announcing the Pi Zero.

So who is the Pi Zero for? Makers building connected devices and robotics projects are likely to be first in line in the queue here. Albeit, at $5 it’s pretty much an impulse purchase… (Indeed, the Pi Zero is being given away free on the
cover of the Foundation’s MagPi magazine.)</p>
